//4. Setting Up Development Environment 
//o Write a program that asks for two numbers and displays their sum. Ensure this is 
//done after setting up the IDE (like Dev C++ or CodeBlocks). 
//o Objective: Help students understand how to install, configure, and run programs 
//in an IDE. 
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
   float num1, num2, sum;

    cout<< "Enter first number  : ";
    cin>> num1;
    cout<< "Enter second number : ";
    cin>>num2;
    sum = num1 + num2;
    cout <<"Result  : "<< num1<<" + "<< num2<< " = "<<sum<< endl;
